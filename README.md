# Proyek Data Warehouse

Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse** repository! 🚀 
This project is my learning effort in understanding the basic concepts and implementation of **data warehousing**, starting from building a simple data warehouse to generating initial insights from the data. This project was created as part of a personal portfolio, with reference to common practices in the field of **data engineering** and **analytics**.

## 🏗️ Arsitektur Data

The data architecture of this project follows the Medallion Architecture approach with three layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data directly from the source system. The data is retrieved from a CSV file and inserted into a SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes cleansing, standardization, and normalization before analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Stores business-ready data, modeled in the form of a *star schema* for reporting and analysis purposes.

## 📖 Project Summary

This project includes:

1. **Data Architecture**: Design a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture (**Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold**).
2. **ETL Pipelines**: The process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the data warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact tables and dimensions optimized for analytical Query.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Here is an advanced repository for analytics and creating reports.

## 🚀 Project Specifications

### Building Data Warehouse

#### Objective
Develop a small-scale data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, so that data-based reporting and decision-making can be done.

#### Spesifikasi
- **Source Data**: Data is imported from two source systems (ERP and CRM) in the form of CSV files.
- Data Quality**: Performed data quality cleaning and improvement before analysis.
- **Integration**: Combined both sources into one data model that is easy to use for analytics purposes.
- Scope**: Focuses on recent datasets only, does not include historical data.
- Documentation**: Provide clear data model documentation to support the needs of business and analytics teams.
